## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you have found a security problem with any of the packages produced
by Kiwi TCMS **DO NOT** report it into GitHub Issues. Instead go to
[https://tidelift.com/security](https://tidelift.com/security)
and follow the instructions there.

The Kiwi TCMS team is registered as a lifter at Tidelift and will be
notified when you report the security problem with them!
